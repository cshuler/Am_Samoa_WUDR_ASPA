    "- Intake Altitude was obtained through extracting DEM elevations directly to estimated intake locations\n",
    "- The Basin Area was calculated by modifying a minor-watersheds shapefile obtained from the  DoC ArcGIS users group to only include watershed area above the intake location. An area calculation was preformed on these modified watershed polygons (see Fig x for polygon shapes) \n",
    "- Basin relief was calculated by looping through each villages modified watershed polygon and using these geometries to clip the Tutuila 3m DEM into a basin specific DEM. Maximum and minimul elevations of the basin specific DEM were extracted, then subtracted to obtain the basin relief.  "
