American Samoa faces a need for a system to facilitate archival and transfer of water-use data from key stakeholders to appropriate repositories such as the USGS Water Use Data Portal. The American Samoa Power Authority currently collects water production and water use data in formats that are relevant to the USGS program, but the information technology (IT) infrastructure required to facilitate data formatting and transmission to the USGS remains a significant need. There is also a need to better understand domestic surface water withdrawals from small unimproved collection systems (referred to here as village water systems), as this is a potentially significant component of territorial water use. More reliable information regarding the use of village water is needed to better understand how prevalent use of these systems is and to quantify how significant these water resources are. This project proposes to fill these needs by developing the information technology (IT) infrastructure needed to access and consolidate site-specific public supply water production and use data, and to perform site visits to known village water systems and conduct interviews with village leaders and community members to develop a preliminary database of village water use and estimates of populations served.
